coll001,fetalimages.jpg,Fetal Images,Emma Goldman Clinic,2003,"A flyer sent to the Emma Goldman Clinic and neighborhoods in Iowa City describing abortion as murder through fetal images. Fake fetal Images are often created and blown up in size to emphasize the 'humanness' of the fetus. Fetal images are a staple of protests outside of clinics and are meant to instill fear and horror in those walking in; attempting to show women that their baby is already alive and a full-bodied human being. 3D ultrasounds were created in the 1980's, and more recently 4D ultrasound videos, which show realistic pictures that accentuate features of 'human' traits on the fetus. These technoogies have helped cement many of the pictures of fetuses that protesters bring to the clinic.",murder;fetus,"Iowa City, Iowa","41.6644401,-91.5355538",,Image appears courtesy of Iowa Women's Archive,,Photo,image/jpeg,eng,,

Bombing of clinics is rare but was a common concern for clinics in the late 1970's into the 1980's, with the first starting in 1978. Crimes committed against abortion providers have included 41 bombings, 173 arsons, 91 attempted bombings or arsons, 619 bomb threats, 1630 incidents of trespassing, 1264 incidents of vandalism, and 100 attacks with butyric acid.

Singing hymns, contemporary Christian songs, and bringing instruments to clinics is a tactic used by peaceful protesters in the physical sense to create a space of perceived comfort for those walking into the clinic, while interrupting needed medical attention.

coll006,15.jpg,Picketing,Emma Goldman Clinic,None,"Picketing is a strange term to describe the way protesters stand outside of clinics as it is often used to legitimize striking from work and other practices that are violent toward people and non-humans. However, in this case those who are picketing believe that they are striking against abortion practices as murder taking place in clinics. By walking in circles and holding up signs that condemn abortion as a practice of murder, they are speaking out against the practices of clinics, which they believe are murdering babies and selling or carelessly disposing their body parts.

Pamphlets often make it inside of clinics with patients, which can be dangerous when other clients see them in the waiting room. Abortion providers will often try to find the pamphlets in the waiting room, which is why there are many of them in the clinic archives. This particular pamphlet gives false information on sexual education and urges people to not use condoms during intercourse for 'medical' and 'moral' reasons.",,"Iowa City, Iowa","41.6644401,-91.5355538",,Image appears courtesy of Iowa Women's Archive,,Photo,image/jpeg,eng,,
